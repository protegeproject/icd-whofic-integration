http://who.int/icf#B	Body functions are the physiological functions of body systems (including psychological functions).
http://who.int/icf#B	Impairments are problems in body function or structure as a significant deviation or loss.
http://who.int/icf#B	Broad ranges of percentages are provided for those cases in which calibrated assessment instruments or other standards are available to quantify the impairment in body function. For example, when "no impairment" or "complete impairment" in body function is coded, this scaling may have margin of error of up to 5%. "Moderate impairment" is generally up to half of the scale of total impairment. The percentages are to be calibrated in different domains with reference to population standards as percentiles. For this quantification to be used in a uniform manner, assessment procedures need to be developed through research.
http://who.int/icf#B	For a further explanation of coding conventions in ICF, refer to Annex 2.
http://who.int/icf#S	Body structures are anatomical parts of the body such as organs, limbs and their components.
http://who.int/icf#S	Impairments are problems in body function or structure as a significant deviation or loss.
http://who.int/icf#S	First qualifier
http://who.int/icf#S	Generic qualifier with the negative scale, used to indicate the extent or an impairment:
http://who.int/icf#D	Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.
http://who.int/icf#D	Participation is involvement in a life situation.
http://who.int/icf#D	Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities.
http://who.int/icf#D	Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations.
http://who.int/icf#D	The domains for the Activities and Participation component are given in a single list that covers the full range of life areas (from basic learning and watching to composite areas such as social tasks). This component can be used to dedefinition activities (a) or participation (p) or both.
http://who.int/icf#D	The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the performance qualifier and the capacity qualifier. The performance qualifier describes what an individual does in his or her current environment. Because the current environment brings in a societal context, performance as recorded by this qualifier can also be understood as "involvement in a life situation" or "the lived experience" of people in the actual context in which they live. This context includes the environmental factors - all aspects of the physical, social and attitudinal world, which can be coded using the Environmental Factors component.
http://who.int/icf#D	The capacity qualifier describes an individual's ability to execute a task or an action. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may reach in a given domain at a given moment. Capacity is measured in a uniform or standard environment, and thus reflects the environmentally adjusted ability of the individual. The Environmental Factors component can be used to describe the features of this uniform or standard environment.
http://who.int/icf#D	Both capacity and performance qualifiers can be used with and without assistive devices or personal assistance, and in accordance with the following scale:
http://who.int/icf#E	Environmental Factors make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives.
http://who.int/icf#E	Environmental Factors is a component of Part 2 (Contextual factors) of the classification. These factors must be considered for each component of functioning and coded accordingly (see Annex 2).
http://who.int/icf#E	Environmental factors are to be coded from the perspective of the person whose situation is being described. For example, kerb cuts without textured paving may be coded as a facilitator for a wheelchair user but as a barrier for a blind person.
http://who.int/icf#E	The first qualifier indicates the extent to which a factor is a facilitator or a barrier. There are several reasons why an environmental factor may be a facilitator or a barrier, and to what extent. For facilitators, the coder should keep in mind issues such as the accessibility of a resource, and whether access is dependable or variable, of good or poor quality and so on. In the case of barriers, it might be relevant how often a factor hinders the person, whether the hindrance is great or small, or avoidable or not. It should also be kept in mind that an environmental factor can be a barrier either because of its presence (for example, negative attitudes towards people with disabilities) or its absence (for example, the unavailability of a needed service). The effects that environmental factors have on the lives of people with health conditions are varied and complex, and it is hoped that future research will lead to better understanding of this interaction and, possibly, show the usefulness of a second qualifier for these factors.
http://who.int/icf#E	In some instances, a diverse collection of environmental factors is summarized with a single term, such as poverty, development, rural or urban setting or social capital. These summary terms are not themselves found in the classification. Rather, the coder should separate the constituent factors and code these. Once again, further research is required to determine whether there are clear and consistent sets of environmental factors that make up each of these summary terms.
http://who.int/icf#E	First qualifier
http://who.int/icf#E	The following is the negative and positive scale for the extent to which an environmental factor acts as a barrier or a facilitator. A point or separator alone dedefinitions a barrier, and the + sign dedefinitions a facilitator, as indicated below:

http://who.int/icf#e1	This chapter is about the natural or human-made products or systems of products, equipment and technology in an individual's immediate environment that are gathered, created, produced or manufactured. The ISO 9999 classification of technical aids defines these as "any product, instrument, equipment or technical system used by a disabled person, especially produced or generally available, preventing, compensating, monitoring, relieving or neutralizing" disability. It is recognized that any product or technology can be assistive. (See ISO 9999: Technical aids for disabled persons -Classification (second version); ISO/TC 173/SC 2; ISO/DIS 9999 (rev.).) For the purposes of this classification of environmental factors, however, assistive products and technology are defined more narrowly as any product, instrument, equipment or technology adapted or specially designed for improving the functioning of a disabled person.

The chapter does not encompass the attitudes of the person or people that are providing the support. The environmental factor being described is not the person or animal, but the amount of physical and emotional support the person or animal provides.
http://who.int/icf#e4	This chapter is about the attitudes that are the observable consequences of customs, practices, ideologies, values, norms, factual beliefs and religious beliefs. These attitudes influence individual behaviour and social life at all levels, from interpersonal relationships, community associations to political, economic and legal structures; for example, individual or societal attitudes about a person's trustworthiness and value as a human being may motivate positive, honorific practices or negative and discriminatory practices (e.g. stigmatizating, stereotyping and marganilizing or neglect of the person). The attitudes classified are those of people external to the person whose situation is being described. They are not those of the person themselves. The individual attitudes are categorized according to the kinds of relationships listed in Environmental Factors Chapter 3. Values and beliefs are not coded separately from attitudes as they are assumed to be the driving forces behind the attitudes.
